# Abstract

  This is an academic research by apply R statistics analysis to an agency A of an existing betting consultancy firm A. According to the [Dixon and Pope (2003)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016920700400010X), due to business confidential and privacy I am also using agency A and firm A in this paper. **The purpose of the anaysis is measure the staking model of the firm A**. For more sample which using R for Soccer Betting see <http://rpubs.com/englianhu>. Here is the references of [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) and [An Introduction to R Markdown](http://rpubs.com/mansun_kuo/24330). You are welcome to read the [Wrangling F1 Data With R](http://www.r-bloggers.com/wrangling-f1-data-with-r-f1datajunkie-book/) if you are getting interest to write a data analysis on Sports-book.

## 1.1 Introducing Betting Strategies

  As a player, we know gambling is that an activities which bet against bankers. Normally gamblers applied few betting strategies to make money from bankers or may be other players. You can try to refer to [数据科学中的R和Python - Data Science is the art of turning data into actions - 如何用21点来击败赌场？](http://xccds1977.blogspot.my/2012/03/21.html)or [Betting Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betting_strategy) for more information.

  Well, I'll introducing some sports betting strategies used by a company **Sports Insights** (You can just read as your own reference, since I've never subscribe thier service, here I term it as **SI**) might help you improve your winning percentage and start making money investing in sports. The following concepts represent some of the most lucrative historical betting trends and are the same tools used by sharp bettors to turn consistent profits.

  - **Sports Betting Strategy 1** - [Betting Against the Public](https://www.sportsinsights.com/how-to-bet-on-sports/betting-against-the-public/)

  Betting Against the Public is one of the most popular and simplest methods used by **SI** to maximize value in the sports betting marketplace.

  - **Sports Betting Strategy 2** - [Reverse-Line Movement](https://www.sportsinsights.com/how-to-bet-on-sports/reverse-line-movement/)

  **SI** will show how analyzing [betting trends data](https://www.sportsinsights.com/betting-trends/) and line movement can help you identify which games the sharp money (wagers placed by sharps, wiseguys or betting syndicates) is taking.

  - **Sports Betting Strategy 3** - [Major Line Moves](https://www.sportsinsights.com/major-line-moves/)

  **SI**'s major line move analysis explains how to interpret line moves across the sports betting marketplace in order to find value.

  This article explains how sportsbooks shade their lines to exploit human tendencies and how you can take advantage by using **SI**'s Betting Against the Public strategy.

  - **Sports Betting Strategy 5** - [Shopping for the Best Line](https://www.sportsinsights.com/shopping-for-the-best-line/)

  Shopping for the best possible number is an easy way to improve your winning percentage over the course of an entire season.

  - **Sports Betting Strategy 6** - [The Importance of Units Won](https://www.sportsinsights.com/sportsbettingarticles/the-importance-of-true-units-won-in-evaluating-betting-strategies/)

  Understanding the importance of units won vs winning percentage will help you evaluate the true worth of any sports betting system.

  [16]*Maurizio Montone (2015)* taking 82 operators' as sample data for research on arbitrages and bookmakers' characteristics. [17]*Steven D. Levitt (2004)* analyse the betslips breakdown which is similar with section 3 in this paper.

## 1.2 Value Betting

  Section [1.1 Introducing Betting Strategies] describe some basic concepts about betting strategies. Now we focus on [Value betting](http://www.valuepunter.com/valuebetting.htm) and it is the popular and efficient staking strategy since money management is the key for betting strategy.

```
  It's not a matter of life or death. But if that team, that result or that referee's decision goes against them, the lives of their wives and their children are affected. The mortgage does not get paid. Holidays are cancelled. They are not players or managers. They are football's professional gamblers.

  It is their full-time job to win money betting on the game. There are not many successful enough to survive. It is estimated, by the gamblers interviewed here, that fewer than 3 percent of gamblers who have what it takes to "go pro" can earn a living from betting.

  No wonder they are a secretive, paranoid bunch. Never do they reveal exactly how they win their money or how much. Their greatest secret is what is known as "the edge". That nugget of information which tells them that the odds on the football betting market is wrong. Only then do they hand over their hard-won dough.

  It takes hours of eye-bleeding research to find "the edge". Most pros spend hours, and thousands of pounds, building statistical models. Others will employ specialists—analysts and statisticians—to build a complex algorithm for them. If successful enough, they will attract wealthy investors who will hand over thousands, sometimes millions, to bet for them and be promised a healthy return.

  Tony Bloom, a legendary gambler known as "The Lizard" is one such operator. So revered, Bloom runs Star Lizard, a company that employs a raft of people to analyse football matches for his millionaire-only investors. Bloom is rumoured to be worth more than £1 billion and owns Brighton, the Premier League wannabes.

  The best and the most successful punters are money managers looking for ideal situations, which are defined as matches with only high percentage of return. In individual situations luck will play into the outcome of an event, which no amount of odds compiling can overcome, but in the long run a disciplined punter will win more of those lucky games than lose.

## 1.3 Professional Gambler
  
  Nowadays, operates make a lot of restriction to increase their profits. For example: single bet maximum stakes per account, triggers upon staking per bet, single match maximum stakes per account, vigorous/spreads margin (Which will describe in [2.2 Overrounds / Vigorish]). As a professional gambler we are require a high level mathematical skill in order to take profit from operators. Below are some articles about sports betting data analysis.

# 2. Data

  * Section [2.1 Collect and Reprocess the Data] - Data from Firm A
  * Section [2.2 Overrounds / Vigorish] - Odds Price and Overrounds Changared by Bookmakers

## 2.1 Collect and Reprocess the Data

  I collect the data-set of World Wide soccer matches from year 2011 until 2015 from a British betting consultancy named firm A. All bets placed by display on HK currency, and the odds price also measure based on Hong Kong price.
  
  I tried to apply `RSelenium` on [**RStudio Server Centos7**](http://rstudio.scibrokes.com) to scrape the data from live-score website includes the odds price but the binary [phantomjs](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12948#issuecomment-131267076) is not available for Linux, and I also not familiar with the installation of `Java` as well as setting of the path for `rJava`. Kindly refer to [Natural Language Analysis](http://rpubs.com/englianhu/natural-language-analysis) for more information about the teams name matching.

  About 90 percent of money wagered will be on the Asian handicap, a market that allows the team expected to win a "head start" of a quarter of a goal or more to the opposition. The rest of the money staked will go on a market for over or under a certain number of goals and the match-result market.

  In order to analyse the AHOU, here I've filtered out all soccer matches other than AHOU which is the table showing above (For example : Corners, Total League Goals etc.) for whole research paper. Please refer to [Natural Language Analysis](http://rpubs.com/englianhu/natural-language-analysis) to see the firm A staking raw data-set.
  
  You are feel free to read [Asian Handicap](http://www.bettingarbitrage.eu/asian-handicap.html) and [Arbitrage of Synthetic Asian Handicap Bets](http://www.sportstradingnetwork.com/arbitrage-synthetic-asian-handicap-bets/) for some basic lession about Asian Handicap Bets.

## 2.2 Overrounds / Vigorish

  **Fair odds**: the odds that would be offered if the sum of the probabilities for all possible outcomes were exactly 1 (100%). For example, supposing we had a market with three possible outcomes {A, B, C} with probabilities of success $P(A) = 0.5, P(B) = 0.4$ and $P(C) = 0.1$, the fair odds would be `2.00`, `2.50`, and `10.00` respectively, which are just the inverse of the estimated probabilities.

  **Overround**: Also called vigorish (or vig for short) in American sports betting, the over-round is a measure of the bookmaker’s edge over the gambler. The bookmaker will never offer fair odds on a market. In practice, the payout offered on each selection will be reduced, which in turn increases the reflected probability of an event. When odds have been adjusted in this way the sum of the probabilities for all events will exceed 1 `(100%)`. The over-round is the amount by which the sum of all
probabilities exceeds `100%` and it is the bookmaker’s profit margin.

  For example, if we had a market with two possible outcomes {A, B}, where $P(A) = P(B) = 0.5$, the fair odds on each selection would be `2.00`. However, the bookmaker may offer payouts of `1.85` on each selection. The corresponding probabilities for each selection are now 1/1.85 = `r 1/1.85`, and the sum of the probabilities for all outcomes is `r 1/1.85` x 2 = `r 1/1.85*2`. The over-round is `8.1%`, and for every `$100` paid out by gamblers the bookmaker expects to make a profit of `8.1` dollars, assuming that there are balanced bets on both A and B.

```{r scrap-data, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
## Scrape the leagues and also overrounds which provides by a sportsbookmaker named Firm B
#'@ lnk <- 'http://data.nowgoal.com/history/handicap.htm'
## Above website provides odds price history but sendkeyElements cannot work in RSelenium, will follow-up
## https://github.com/ropensci/RSelenium/issues/55
## Therefore scrape spbo link to know the league of matches

## Besides, need to scrap the final-scores / half-time scores / result of soccer matches
#'@ dateID <- sort(unique(mbase$datasets$Date)); spboDate <- gsub('-','',dateID)
#'@ lnk <- paste0('http://www8.spbo.com/history.plex?day=', spboDate, '&l=en')
## kick-off time(GMT+8) - 12hrs since livescore website start count a day from 12pm(GMT+8)
dateID <- as.Date(sort(unique(dat$Date) - hm('12:00'))); spboDate <- gsub('-', '', dateID)

## Due to the scrapSPBO function scrapped unmatched data, example lnk[827],
##  therefore I rewrite the function as scrapSPBO2
#'@ suppressAll(source('function/scrapSPBO2.R'))
#'@ scrapSPBO2(lnk = lnk, dateID = dateID, path = 'livescore', parallel = TRUE)

## Read spbo livescore datasets.
spboData <- readSPBO(dateID = dateID, parallel = FALSE)$data

## Apply stringdist() to 'exactly matching' and 'approximate matching' team names
#'@ method <- c('osa', 'lv', 'dl', 'hamming', 'lcs', 'qgram', 'cosine', 'jaccard', 'jw', 'soundex')
#'@ source(paste0(getwd(),'/function/arrTeamID.R'))
#'@ tmID <- arrTeamID(mbase, spboData, parallel = FALSE)
tmIDdata <- read.csv('./data/teamID.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ',') %>% mutate_each(funs(as.character)) %>% data.frame %>% tbl_df %>% filter(spbo != 'Kuban Krasnodar')
spboData %<>% filter((Home %in% tmIDdata$spbo)|(Away %in% tmIDdata$spbo))

rm(dateID, spboDate, readSPBO)
```
  
  I just simply get the lay price by applying below equation.
  
$$P_i^{HK_{Lay}} = 1/P_i^{HK_{Back}}-\nu_{j}$$   *equation 2.2.1*
  
  While $\nu$ is the vigorish and $j={1,2}$ which are `r names(lProfile)[1]`=`r lProfile[1]` and `r names(lProfile)[2]`=`r lProfile[1]`. I have just simply calculated the Layed Fair odds (Odds Price with Vigorish which offer by operators), here I apply a setting profile which is term as `lProfile` (you can casually edit the soccer match profile setting) to get the Real Odds (Net Odds Price without Vigorish). As well as the Value $Value = Real Price/Fair Odds$. Here we can use the Bet Stake Calculator [Kelly Staking Calculator](http://www.sportsbettingcalculator.co.uk/kelly-staking-calculator/). I simply reverse value $\Re$ to get the estimated $P_{i}^{EM}$ (firm A) where we will talk in Section [4.1 Linear Model] and later [4.3 Poisson Modelling] about odds modelling.

```{r data-prob-table1, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
## Calculate the Real Odds (Net Odds Price without Vigorish)
## fMYPriceB = Back without vigorish net price; netProbL = Lay without vigorish net price
## fMYPriceB adn fMYPriceL are MYPrice, here we term as Real Odds
## Please refer to function arrfirmDatasets()

dat %>% select(No, EUPrice, HKPrice, fHKPriceL, fMYPriceB, fMYPriceL, netProbB, netProbL) %>% head %>% kable(caption = 'Table 2.2.1 : Sample Data of Virogish/Overrounds and Odds Price')
```

*table 2.2.1* : `r paste0(dim(dat), collapse = ' x ')` : *Vigorish, price and probabilities sample table.*

  Above *table 2.2.1* just provides some sample about the odds price and over-round while you can refer to *table 2.1.1* for details. Meanwhile, you can know more details about the *return of investment*, *convertion* and also *origin region* based on *same probabilities* among different Odds Types/Styles via [Betting Odds Converter](http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-tools/odds-converter/) or just simply google'ing.

  From above tables, firm A mostly placed on Asian Handicap range concedes/taken `r m %>% filter(Stakes == max(Stakes), AHOU == 'AH') %>% .$HCap` ball on agency A. Menwhile the odds `r m %>% filter(AHOU == 'AH', R.percent == max(R.percent)) %>% .$HCap` is most profitable from return rate.

  Secondly, from the Goal Line mostly taking `r ahBets %>% filter(AHOU == 'OU') %>% filter(Stakes == max(Stakes)) %>% .$Picked` selection on `r ahBets %>% filter(AHOU == 'OU') %>% filter(Stakes == max(Stakes)) %>% .$HCap` balls. (Since Dutch, Japanese, Spanish and Women soccer leagues always scoring more goals, but Portuguese, Italian, French leagues always score less, English leagues average `2.5` balls)

  Above graph shows the Stakes and P&L on different price range in MY Odds style. In fact the MY Odds Style will be easier to count and understand in statistics as well as plot graph since the return (both won and lost) will be ONLY from `-1` to `1` while HK/Europe Odds Style will count from `-1` to `Inf`. However I keep both HKOdds and MYOdds Please refer to *table 2.2.1* for more details.
  
  However, due to consideration of the stakes amount, here I just simply use the HK in order to make the Stakes and Return/PL exactly same with the dataset.

  Section 3 summarise breakdown tables and also graphs on the investment of firm A. Basically, soccer sports investment need to consider below criteria :

- **Handicap** in [3.2 Summarise the Staking Handicap]
- **Price** in [3.3 Summarise the Staking Prices]
- **Timing** in [3.4 Summarise the In-Play Staking Timing]
- **Current Score** in [3.5 Summarise the In-Play Staking Based on Current Score]

  While the further linear model will also take above criteria for investment. You can also refer to my previous research which is [Odds Modelling and Testing Inefficiency of Sports-Bookmakers](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ifwczokjptt6re0/AADv1VarJoQ6IgIitZBzG5c6a?dl=0).

## 4.1 Basic Equation

  Before we start modelling, we look at the summary of investment return rates.

```{r data-return-summary-table1, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
## Get the investment return rates per annun
## http://www.math.ku.dk/~rolf/teaching/thesis/DixonColes.pdf
## value rRates is based on annual EMProb/netProb ratio, while EMProb get from equation 4.1.2
m <- ddply(dat, .(Sess), summarise, Stakes = sum(Stakes), Return = sum(Return), n = length(Sess), rRates = Return / Stakes)

m %>% kable(caption = "Table 4.1.1 : Annual Return of Investment. ('0,000)")
```

*table 4.1.1* : `r paste0(dim(m), collapse=' x ')` : *Return of annually investment summary table.*

$$\Re = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\rho_{i}^{EM}/\sum_{i=1}^{n}\rho_{i}^{BK}$$   *equation 4.1.1*

  $\Re$ is the return rates of investment. The $\rho_i^{EM}$ is the estimated probabilities which is the calculated by firm A from match 1,2... until $n$ matches while $\rho_{i}^{BK}$ is the net/pure probability (real odds) offer by bookmakers after we fit the *equation 4.1.2* into *equation 4.1.1*.

$$\rho_i = P_i^{Lay} / (P_i^{Back} + P_i^{Lay})$$   *equation 4.1.2*

$P_i^{Back}$ and $P_i^{Lay}$ is the backed and layed fair price offer by bookmakers.

  We can simply apply equation above to get the value $\Re$. From the table above we know that the EMPrice calculated by firm A **invested** at a threshold edge (price greater) `r m$rRates` than the prices offer by bookmakers. There are some description about $\Re$ on [Dixon & Coles 1996](http://www.math.ku.dk/~rolf/teaching/thesis/DixonColes.pdf). The optimal value of $\rho_{i}$ (`rEMProbB`) will be calculated based on bootstrapping/resampling method in section [4.2 Kelly Ⓜodel].

```{r data-prob-table2, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}

dat %>% select(No, EUPrice, HKPrice, fHKPriceL, fMYPriceB, fMYPriceL, netProbB, netProbL, rEMProbB, rEMProbL, favNetProb, undNetProb) %>% .[sample(1:nrow(.), 6), ] %>% kable(caption = 'Table 4.1.2 : Probabilities Table')
```

*table 4.1.2* : `r paste0(dim(dat), collapse = ' x ')` : *Odds price and probabilities sample table.*

  Above table list a part of sample odds prices and probabilities of soccer match $i$ while $n$ indicates the number of soccer matches. We can know the values `rEMProbB`, `netProbB` and so forth.

preData <- filter(dat, InPlay == 'No' & InPlay2 == 'No')
hdp <- sort(unique(as.numeric(as.character(dat$HCap))))
hdp
```

## 4.2 Linear Ⓜodel

  From our understanding of staking, the covariates we need to consider should be only odds price since the handicap's covariate has settled according to different handicap of EMOdds.

```{r plot4.2.1, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
n1 <- rPlot(Return ~ Stakes, data = dat, color = 'Stakes', type = 'point')
n1$addControls('x', value = 'Stakes', values = names(dat))
n1$addControls('y', value = 'Stakes', values = names(dat))
n1$addControls('color', value = 'Stakes', values = names(dat))
n1
```

  Again, I don't pretend to know the correct Ⓜodel, here I simply apply linear model to retrieve the value of *EMOdds* derived from stakes. The purpose of measure the edge overcame bookmakers' vigorish is *to know the levarage of the staking activities onto 1 unit edge of odds price by firm A to agency A*.

```{r linear-models, echo = FALSE, result = 'asis'}
## Choosing the variables of linear models
## The net probabilities might open diversified handicap, therefore the HCap parameter need to be insert as one of parameter since the return of draw-no-bet, win-half, win-full, loss-half, loss-full (example : 0, 0/0.5, 0.5, 0.5/1, 1) affect the return of investment.

## Linear Mixed Effects Models

The authors cannot distinguish between inside information and operating costs, merely concluding that combined they account for up to 3.7% of turnover. They compare different versions of our model, using data from races in Ireland in 1993. The authors' empirical results can be summarised as follows:
  
  - They reject the hypothesis that bookmakers behave in a riskneutral manner;
  - They cannot reject the hypothesis that they are infinitely riskaverse;
  - They estimate gross margins to be up to 4 per cent of total oncourse turnover; and
  - They estimate that 3.1 to 3.7% (by value) of all bets are placed by punters with inside information.

## 4.3 Kelly Ⓜodel

  From the papers [Niko Marttinen2001](http://www.ylikerroin.com/file/Complete.pdf) and [Jeffrey Alan Logan Snyder 2013](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jasnyder/papers/thesis.pdf) both applying **Full-Kelly**,**Half-Kelly** and also **Quarter-Kelly** models which similar with my previous Kelly-Criterion model [englianhu2014](http://rpubs.com/englianhu/kelly_eng1112) but enhanced.

  To achieve the level of profitable betting, one must develop a correct money management procedure. The aim for a punter is to maximize the winnings and minimize the losses. If the punter is capable of predicting accurate probabilities for each match, the [Kelly criterion](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall12/papers/Thorpe_KellyCriterion2007.pdf) has proven to work effectively in betting. It was named after an American economist [John Kelly (1956)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?reload = TRUE&tp=&arnumber=6771227) and originally designed for information transmission. The Kelly criterion is described below:

$$S=(\rho*\sigma-1)/(\sigma-1)$$   *equation-4.3.1*

  Where S = the stake expressed as a fraction of one's total bankroll, $\rho$ = probability of an event to take place, $\sigma$ = odds for an event offered by the bookmaker. Three important properties, mentioned by Hausch and Ziemba (1994) ([Efficiency of Racetrack Betting Markets (2008Edition)](http://stocksfirst.com/books/trading-econ-investing/Efficiency%20of%20Racetrack%20Betting%20Mkts%20-%20Ziemba%202008.pdf)), arise when using this criterion to determine a proper stake for each bet:

  - It maximizes the asymptotic growth rate of capital
  - Asymptotically, it minimizes the expected time to reach a specified goal
  - It outperforms in the long run any other essentially different strategy almost surely

  The criterion is known to economists and financial theorists by names such as the geometric mean maximizing portfolio strategy, the growth-optimal strategy, the capital growth criterion, etc. We will now show that Kelly betting will maximize the expected log utility for sports-book betting.

  Now we look at abpve function from a different perspective by considering the observed values $x1, x2, …, xn$ to be fixed *parameters* of this function, whereas $\rho$ will be the function's variable and allowed to vary freely; this function will be called the [**likelihood**](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/191).


## 4.4 Poisson Ⓜodel

  Here we introduce the [Dixon & Coles 1996](http://www.math.ku.dk/~rolf/teaching/thesis/DixonColes.pdf) Poisson model and its codes. You are freely learning from below links if interest.

```{r data-Poisson, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
## Apply Poisson model to simulate different scores to maximum likelihood value ρ.
## reverse Kelly Criterion to abtain the average EMPrice, reversed bivarite poisson to get the EMprobB

## Test if placed multiple bets on same match
preData[duplicated(preData[c('Date','Home','Away')]),c('Date','Home','Away','HG','AG','InPlay','InPlay2','Mins','Mins2','Picked2')]

```

  Due to the soccer matches randomly getting from different leagues, and also not Bernoulli win-lose result but half win-lose etc as we see from above. Besides, there were mixed Pre-Games and also In-Play soccer matches and I filter-up the sample data to be `r paste(dim(preData), collapse=' x ')`. I don't pretend to know the correct answer or the model from firm A. However I take a sample presentation [An introduction to football modelling at Smartodds](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/siamstudentchapter/webpages/2011_Conference/Robert_Talk.pdf) from one of consultancy firm which is Dixon-Coles model and omitted the scoring process section.

  Here I cannot reverse computing from barely $\rho_i^{EM}$ without know the $\lambda_{ij}$ and $\gamma$ values. Therefore I try to using both Home and Away Scores to simulate and test to get the maximum likelihood $\rho_i^{EM}$.

$$X_{ij} = pois(\gamma \alpha_{ij} \beta_{ij} ); Y_{ij} = pois(\alpha_{ij} \beta_{ij})$$   *equation 4.4.1*

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
## Apply Poison model to simulate the result of the matches
## Apply the Kelly model (iterations) to test the efficiency of the value betting from  Sportsbook consultancy firm A
## Apply poisson model to simulate different scores and result to test the efficiency of the staking model.
## reverse Kelly Criterion to abtain the average EMPrice, reversed bivarite poisson to get the EMprobB

## 6.1 Conclusion

  Due to the data-sets I collected just one among all agents among couple sports-bookmakers [4lowin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFYS0jdSiWc). Here I cannot determine if the sample data among the population...

**JA**: What skills and academic training (example: college courses) are valuable to sports statisticians?
**KW**: I would say there are three sets of skills you need to be a successful sports statistician:
  - Quantitative skills - the statistical and mathematical techniques you'll use to make sense of the data. Most kinds of coursework you'd find in an applied statistics program will be helpful. Regression methods, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, inference, probability, ANOVA, multivariate analysis, linear and logistic models, clustering, time series, and data mining/machine learning would all be applicable. I'd include in this category designing charts, graphs, and other data visualizations to help present and communicate results.
  - Technical skills - learning one or more statistical software systems such as R/S-PLUS, SAS, SPSS, Stata, Matlab, etc. will give you the tools to apply quantitative skills in practice. Beyond that, the more self-reliant you are at extracting and manipulating your data directly, the more quickly you can explore your data and test ideas. So being adept with the technology you're likely to encounter will help tremendously. Most of the information you'd be dealing with in sports statistics would be in a database, so learning SQL or another query language is important. In addition, mastering advanced spreadsheet skills such as pivot tables, macros, scripting, and chart customization would be useful.
  - Domain knowledge - truly understanding the sport you want to analyze professionally is critical to being successful. Knowing the rules of the game; studying how front offices operate; finding out how players are recruited, developed, and evaluated; and even just learning the jargon used within the industry will help you integrate into the organization. You'll come to understand what problems are important to the GM and other decisionmakers, as well as what information is available, how it's collected, what it means, and what its limitations are. Also, I recommend keeping up with the discussions in your sport's analytic community so you know about the latest developments and what's considered the state of the art in the public sphere. One of the great things about being a sports statistician is getting to follow your favorite websites and blogs as a legitimate part of your job!

## 7.3 Speech and Blooper

  Firstly I do appreciate those who shade me a light on my research. Meanwhile I do happy and learn from the research.

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pv-KRj9XxXc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  There are quite some errors when I **knit HTML**:
  
  * let say always stuck (which is not response and consider as completed) at 29%. I tried couple times while sometimes prompt me different errors (upgrade Droplet to larger RAM memory space doesn't helps) and eventually apply `rm() and gc()` to remove the object after use and also clear the memory space.

  * Need to reload the package `suppressAll(library('networkD3'))` which in chunk `decission-tree-A` prior to apply function `simpleNetwork` while I load it in chunk `libs` at the beginning of the section 1. Otherwise cannot found that particlar function.

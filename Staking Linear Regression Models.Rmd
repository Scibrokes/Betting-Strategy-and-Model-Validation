  This is a submodule for staking linear regression model when I am doing research on [Betting Strategy and Model Validation](https://rpubs.com/englianhu/Betting-Strategy-and-Model-Validation). The purpose of creating the submodel in order to apply diversify and different models to test and choose the best fitted model.

```{r read-data-summary-table, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
## Read the datasets
## Refer to **Testing efficiency of coding.Rmd** at chunk `get-data-summary-table-2.1`
years <- seq(2011, 2015)

## Here I take the majority leagues setting profile which are "league-10-12"
## fMYPriceB = Back with vigorish price; fMYPriceL = Lay with vigorish price
## Here we term as Fair Odds
lProfile <- c(AH=0.10, OU=0.12)

mbase <- readfirmDatasets(years=years) %>% arrfirmDatasets(lProfile=lProfile)

## In order to analyse the AHOU, here I need to filter out all soccer matches other than AHOU. (For example : Corners, Total League Goals etc.)
## the stakes amount display as $1 = $10,000
#'@ mbase$datasets[!(mbase$datasets$Home %in% mbase$corners)|!(mbase$datasets$Away %in% mbase$corners),]
dat <- mbase$datasets %>% filter((!Home %in% mbase$others)|(!Away %in% mbase$others)) %>% mutate(Stakes=Stakes/10000, Return=Return/10000, PL=PL/10000)

rm(years, readfirmDatasets, arrfirmDatasets)
rm(mbase) ## We need to scrap the livescore data based on the raw data mbase without filter, but this is not the point in this research paper.
```

  There are `r paste0(dim(dat), collapse=' x ')` soccer matches collected for the research. Here I skip the elebroration for the data. Kindly refer to parent module.

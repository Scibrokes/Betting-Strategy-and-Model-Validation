# Abstract

  This is an academic research by apply R statistics analysis to an agency A of an existing betting consultancy firm A. According to the [Dixon and Pope (2003)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016920700400010X), due to business confidential and privacy I am also using agency A and firm A in this paper. **The purpose of the anaysis is measure the staking model of the firm A**. For more sample which using R for Soccer Betting see <http://rpubs.com/englianhu>. Here is the references of [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) and [An Introduction to R Markdown](http://rpubs.com/mansun_kuo/24330). You are welcome to read the [Wrangling F1 Data With R](http://www.r-bloggers.com/wrangling-f1-data-with-r-f1datajunkie-book/) if you are getting interest to write a data analysis on Sports-book.

## 4.1 Basic Equation

  Before we start modelling, we look at the summary of investment return rates.

```{r data-return-summary-table1, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
## Get the investment return rates per annun
## http://www.math.ku.dk/~rolf/teaching/thesis/DixonColes.pdf
## value rRates is based on annual EMProb/netProb ratio, while EMProb get from equation 4.1.2
m <- ddply(dat, .(Sess), summarise, Stakes = sum(Stakes), Return = sum(Return), n = length(Sess), rRates = Return / Stakes)

m %>% formattable %>% as.htmlwidget
```

*table 4.1.1* : `r paste0(dim(m), collapse=' x ')` : *Return of annually investment summary table.*

$$\Re = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\rho_{i}^{EM}/\sum_{i=1}^{n}\rho_{i}^{BK}$$   *equation 4.1.1*

  $\Re$ is the return rates of investment. The $\rho_i^{EM}$ is the estimated probabilities which is the calculated by firm A from match 1,2... until $n$ matches while $\rho_{i}^{BK}$ is the net/pure probability (real odds) offer by bookmakers after we fit the *equation 4.1.2* into *equation 4.1.1*.

$$\rho_i = P_i^{Lay} / (P_i^{Back} + P_i^{Lay})$$   *equation 4.1.2*

$P_i^{Back}$ and $P_i^{Lay}$ is the backed and layed fair price offer by bookmakers.

  We can simply apply equation above to get the value $\Re$. From the table above we know that the EMPrice calculated by firm A **invested** at a threshold edge (price greater) `r m$rRates` than the prices offer by bookmakers. There are some description about $\Re$ on [Dixon & Coles 1996](https://github.com/scibrokes/odds-modelling-and-testing-inefficiency-of-sports-bookmakers/blob/master/reference/DixonColes1996.pdf). The optimal value of $\rho_{i}$ (`rEMProbB`) will be calculated based on bootstrapping/resampling method in section [4.3 Kelly Ⓜodel].

```{r data-prob-table2, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}

dat %>% select(No, EUPrice, HKPrice, fHKPriceL, fMYPriceB, fMYPriceL, netProbB, netProbL, rEMProbB, rEMProbL, favNetProb, undNetProb) %>% .[sample(1:nrow(.), 6), ] %>% formattable %>% as.htmlwidget
```

*table 4.1.2* : `r paste0(dim(dat), collapse = ' x ')` : *Odds price and probabilities sample table.*

  Above table list a part of sample odds prices and probabilities of soccer match $i$ while $n$ indicates the number of soccer matches. We can know the values `rEMProbB`, `netProbB` and so forth.

## 4.2 Linear Ⓜodel

  From our understanding of staking, the covariates we need to consider should be only odds price since the handicap's covariate has settled according to different handicap of EMOdds.

```{r plot4.2.1, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
n1 <- rPlot(Return ~ Stakes, data = dat, color = 'Stakes', type = 'point')
n1$addControls('x', value = 'Stakes', values = names(dat))
n1$addControls('y', value = 'Stakes', values = names(dat))
n1$addControls('color', value = 'Stakes', values = names(dat))
#'@ n1$print(include_assets = TRUE)
#'@ 
n1
```

  Again, I don't pretend to know the correct Ⓜodel, here I simply apply linear model to retrieve the value of *EMOdds* derived from stakes. The purpose of measure the edge overcame bookmakers' vigorish is *to know the levarage of the staking activities onto 1 unit edge of odds price by firm A to agency A*.

```{r linear-models, echo = FALSE, result = 'asis'}
## Choosing the variables of linear models
## The net probabilities might open diversified handicap, therefore the HCap parameter need to be insert as one of parameter since the return of draw-no-bet, win-half, win-full, loss-half, loss-full (example : 0, 0/0.5, 0.5, 0.5/1, 1) affect the return of investment.
lm0 <- lm(Return ~ Stakes, data = dat)
lm1 <- lm(Return ~ Stakes + HCap, data = dat)
lm2 <- lm(Return ~ Stakes + netProbB, data = dat)
lm3 <- lm(Return ~ Stakes + HCap + netProbB, data = dat)
lm4 <- lm(Return ~ Stakes + ipRange, data = dat)
lm5 <- lm(Return ~ Stakes + ipHCap, data = dat)
lm6 <- lm(Return ~ Stakes + HCap + ipRange, data = dat)
lm7 <- lm(Return ~ Stakes + CurScore + ipHCap, data = dat)
lm8 <- lm(Return ~ Stakes + CurScore + ipRange, data = dat)
lm9 <- lm(Return ~ Stakes + CurScore + ipRange + ipHCap, data = dat)

## Linear Interative Effect Models
lm10 <- lm(Return ~ HCap + netProbB + HCap:netProbB, data = dat)
lm11 <- lm(Return ~ Stakes + ipHCap + ipRange + ipHCap:ipRange, data = dat)
lm12 <- lm(Return ~ Stakes + CurScore + ipRange + ipHCap + CurScore:ipHCap:ipRange, data = dat)

## Linear Mixed Effects Models
## Mixed effect categorised the parameters by group... similar with current score during living betting modelling, the scoring rate (intensity of scores) during 0-0 is different with scoring rates during 1-0 etc.
lm0 <- lm(Return ~ Stakes + (1|HCap), data = dat)
lm0 <- lm(Return ~ HCap + (1|Stakes), data = dat) # the stakes amount placed by firm A must be based on the degree of the edges to punter. Here I try to test the effect. (Although firm A might bet via several agents, here I can only took available sample from population to test the efficiency.)

The authors cannot distinguish between inside information and operating costs, merely concluding that combined they account for up to 3.7% of turnover. They compare different versions of our model, using data from races in Ireland in 1993. The authors' empirical results can be summarised as follows:
  
  - They reject the hypothesis that bookmakers behave in a riskneutral manner;
  - They cannot reject the hypothesis that they are infinitely riskaverse;
  - They estimate gross margins to be up to 4 per cent of total oncourse turnover; and
  - They estimate that 3.1 to 3.7% (by value) of all bets are placed by punters with inside information.

  Here I try to test our data if there has any insider information.

## 4.3 Kelly Ⓜodel

  From the papers *Niko Marttinen 2001*^[Kindly refer to 1th paper in [7.4 References]] and *Jeffrey Alan Logan Snyder 2013*^[Kindly refer to 2nd paper in [7.4 References]] both applying **Full-Kelly**,**Half-Kelly** and also **Quarter-Kelly** models which similar with my previous Kelly-Criterion model *®γσ, Eng Lian Hu 2014*^[Kindly refer to 4th paper in [7.4 References]] but enhanced.

  To achieve the level of profitable betting, one must develop a correct money management procedure. The aim for a punter is to maximize the winnings and minimize the losses. If the punter is capable of predicting accurate probabilities for each match, the *Edward O. Thorp 2006*^[Kindly refer to 6th paper in [7.4 References]] has proven to work effectively in betting. It was named after an American economist [John Kelly (1956)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?reload = TRUE&tp=&arnumber=6771227) and originally designed for information transmission. The Kelly criterion is described below:

$$S=(\rho*\sigma-1)/(\sigma-1)$$   *equation-4.3.1*

  Where S = the stake expressed as a fraction of one's total bankroll, $\rho$ = probability of an event to take place, $\sigma$ = odds for an event offered by the bookmaker. Three important properties, mentioned by Hausch and Ziemba (1994) ([Efficiency of Racetrack Betting Markets (2008Edition)](http://stocksfirst.com/books/trading-econ-investing/Efficiency%20of%20Racetrack%20Betting%20Mkts%20-%20Ziemba%202008.pdf)), arise when using this criterion to determine a proper stake for each bet:

  - It maximizes the asymptotic growth rate of capital
  - Asymptotically, it minimizes the expected time to reach a specified goal
  - It outperforms in the long run any other essentially different strategy almost surely

  The criterion is known to economists and financial theorists by names such as the geometric mean maximizing portfolio strategy, the growth-optimal strategy, the capital growth criterion, etc. We will now show that Kelly betting will maximize the expected log utility for sports-book betting.

```{r data-Kelly, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}

## 1. Summarise the data which group by Date
accBets <- ddply(dat, .(Date), summarise, Stakes = sum(Stakes), S.median = median(Stakes),
                S.mean = mean(Stakes), S.sd = sd(Stakes), Count = length(PL), PL = sum(PL), PL.percent = PL / Stakes)

## 2. Set initial bankroll as 1,000,000
dat$iniBR <- c(1000000, cumsum(dat$Return[-1]))
dat$K <- ((dat$EUPrice + 1) * dat$rEMProbB - 1) / (dat$EUPrice)

exp(mean(log(dat$Stakes)))

```

$$K = \frac{(B + 1)p - 1} {B}$$   *equation 4.3.1*

$$G: = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{N \to \infty } \frac{1/N}{\log}\left( {\frac{{{BR_N}}}{{{BR_0}}}} \right)$$   *equation 4.3.2*

$$BR_N = (1 + K)^W(1 - K)^L BR_0$$   *equation 4.3.3*

  In order to get the optimal value, I apply the bootrapping and resampling method.
  
$$L(\rho) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i}|\rho)$$   *equation 4.3.4*

  Due to the soccer matches randomly getting from different leagues, and also not Bernoulli win-lose result but half win-lose etc as we see from above. Besides, there were mixed Pre-Games and also In-Play soccer matches and I filter-up the sample data to be `r paste(dim(preData), collapse=' x ')`. I don't pretend to know the correct answer or the model from firm A. However I take a sample presentation [An introduction to football modelling at Smartodds](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/siamstudentchapter/webpages/2011_Conference/Robert_Talk.pdf) from one of consultancy firm which is Dixon-Coles model and omitted the scoring process section.

  Here I cannot reverse computing from barely $\rho_i^{EM}$ without know the $\lambda_{ij}$ and $\gamma$ values. Therefore I try to using both Home and Away Scores to simulate and test to get the maximum likelihood $\rho_i^{EM}$.

$$X_{ij} = pois(\gamma \alpha_{ij} \beta_{ij} ); Y_{ij} = pois(\alpha_{ij} \beta_{ij})$$   *equation 4.4.1*

## 6.1 Conclusion

  Due to the data-sets I collected just one among all agents among couple sports-bookmakers [4lowin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFYS0jdSiWc). Here I cannot determine if the sample data among the population...

**JA**: What skills and academic training (example: college courses) are valuable to sports statisticians?
**KW**: I would say there are three sets of skills you need to be a successful sports statistician:
  - Quantitative skills - the statistical and mathematical techniques you'll use to make sense of the data. Most kinds of coursework you'd find in an applied statistics program will be helpful. Regression methods, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, inference, probability, ANOVA, multivariate analysis, linear and logistic models, clustering, time series, and data mining/machine learning would all be applicable. I'd include in this category designing charts, graphs, and other data visualizations to help present and communicate results.
  - Technical skills - learning one or more statistical software systems such as R/S-PLUS, SAS, SPSS, Stata, Matlab, etc. will give you the tools to apply quantitative skills in practice. Beyond that, the more self-reliant you are at extracting and manipulating your data directly, the more quickly you can explore your data and test ideas. So being adept with the technology you're likely to encounter will help tremendously. Most of the information you'd be dealing with in sports statistics would be in a database, so learning SQL or another query language is important. In addition, mastering advanced spreadsheet skills such as pivot tables, macros, scripting, and chart customization would be useful.
  - Domain knowledge - truly understanding the sport you want to analyze professionally is critical to being successful. Knowing the rules of the game; studying how front offices operate; finding out how players are recruited, developed, and evaluated; and even just learning the jargon used within the industry will help you integrate into the organization. You'll come to understand what problems are important to the GM and other decisionmakers, as well as what information is available, how it's collected, what it means, and what its limitations are. Also, I recommend keeping up with the discussions in your sport's analytic community so you know about the latest developments and what's considered the state of the art in the public sphere. One of the great things about being a sports statistician is getting to follow your favorite websites and blogs as a legitimate part of your job!

## 7.3 Speech and Blooper

  Firstly I do appreciate those who shade me a light on my research. Meanwhile I do happy and learn from the research.

  There are quite some errors when I **knit HTML**:
  
  * let say always stuck (which is not response and consider as completed) at 29%. I tried couple times while sometimes prompt me different errors (upgrade Droplet to larger RAM memory space doesn't helps) and eventually apply `rm() and gc()` to remove the object after use and also clear the memory space.

  * Need to reload the package `suppressAll(library('networkD3'))` which in chunk `decission-tree-A` prior to apply function `simpleNetwork` while I load it in chunk `libs` at the beginning of the section 1. Otherwise cannot found that particlar function.
